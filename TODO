- Add examples to doccomments
- Add data/ folder and some datasets
- Add tests
- Turn some list fields into attributes
- Warning in both MANOVA and mv assumptions when nvars >= nobs (e.g. "requires more samples")
- Allow loading data from matrices (not only files)
- Allow outputs to have different lengths
- Either separate assumptions into a different package or make dependencies optional
