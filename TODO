- grpoutputs should also group existing environment variables and concatenate
them if necessary. The micomp function should leverage on this instead of
artificially creating a grpoutputs object when environment data is passed, thus
allowing to concatenate environment variables, something which it currently does
not support.
- micomp should check the grpoutputs objects concat flag and check if it is
consistent with the concat flag passed to micomp.
- Add tests to multivarexp changes: cmpoutput, micomp, toLatex, centerscale,
ve_npcs in micomp and cmpoutput
- Package level doc, method for doc and for README.md
