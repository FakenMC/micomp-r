### Summary

_micompr_ is an [R] package for multivariate independent comparison of
observations. It can, for example, compare two or more sets of time series in
order to determine if they are statistically dissimilar.

### How to install

Install the development version from GitHub with the following command (requires
the [devtools] package):

```R
devtools::install_github("fakenmc/micompr")
```
The package has been submitted to [CRAN] and, if accepted, will be installable
via the following instruction:

```R
install.package("micompr")
```

### Documentation

help("micompr")
```

Additionally, the package contains two vignettes with a number of examples.
