### Summary

_micompr_ is an [R] package for multivariate independent comparison of
observations.

### How to install

Since the package is under development, a direct installation from GitHub is
recommended. The following command requires the [devtools] package and installs
_micompr_ from source:

```R
devtools::install_github("fakenmc/micompr")

documented. A user manual will be available soon.
