Description: This package implements a procedure for comparing multivariate
    samples associated with different groups. The procedure uses principal
    component analysis to convert multivariate observations into a set of
    linearly uncorrelated statistical measures, which are then compared using a
    number of statistical methods. This technique is independent of the
    distributional properties of samples and automatically selects features that
    best explain their differences, avoiding manual selection of specific points
    or summary statistics. The procedure is appropriate for comparing samples of
    time series, images, spectrometric measures or similar multivariate
    observations.
